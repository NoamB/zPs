zPs

zbro's PHP site (zPs) Alpha (c) 2004 Noam Ben Ari

This project is a CMS I wrote using PHP during 2004.

It includes features such as:
- admin management console
- saving HTML templates to DB
- Fully working forums with view/edit/create, pagination, flat/tree view of posts and more
- online activity of users
- login/logout/register/activation
- front page news

It was the first site I wrote in PHP and actually the first server side project I ever wrote.

I've uploaded it to github just for the nostalgic value (although I might check it again for the pagination logic someday...).

If someone finds it useful... I'll be really surprised! Do let me know!
